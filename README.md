# **WTWR - What To Wear React App** ðŸ§¥ðŸ§³

This project is a front-end web application built with **React** that helps users decide what to wear based on the current weather. It fetches weather data via the **OpenWeather API**, and dynamically displays clothing recommendations based on the temperature. The app features a set of clothing cards, modals for item details, and filtering by weather conditions.

## **Key Features**

- **Dynamic Clothing Cards**: Clothing items are displayed as cards, each with an image and title, dynamically generated from a hard-coded data array.
- **Weather API Integration**: The app makes a call to the **OpenWeather API** to fetch current weather data, including location and temperature.
- **Location and Temperature Display**: The app displays the current location and temperature in the header.
- **Weather-based Filtering**: Clothing cards are filtered based on the current weather conditions, showing items suitable for hot, warm, or cold weather.
- **Modal Functionality**: Clicking on a clothing card opens a modal with more details about the item. A separate modal allows users to add new clothing items.
- **Adaptive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes, using **CSS** best practices and adaptive design principles.
